Description

ATTENTION: since many people seems to be asking for premade database lately and aren't willing to go collect their own data, I'll stress one more time that Database importing IS NOT SUPPORTED.
And please, do not post url pointing to site hosting such files.

Gatherer is a WoW addon for herbalists, miners and treasure hunters. It's main purpose is to track the closest plants, deposits and treasure locations on you minimap.

The addon does not track like a tracking ability does, rather it "remembers" where you have found various items in the past. It does this whenever you gather (perform herbalism, mining or opening) on an item, and records the specific map location in it's history. From then on, whenever the item comes into range of being one of the closest 1-25 (configurable) items to your present location, it will pop up on you minimap (see screenshot here).

Installation:
Installation is easy, simply download the above zip file, and expand it's contents into the "World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns" folder. The final path of the files when extracted with full path information should be "World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/Gatherer"

Usage:
The usage of Gatherer is fairly straightforward. You simply use the game as normal, and the tracked items will appear in you minimap as soon as you gather them.

There are several configuration options and commands that can be configured via slash commands within the game.

/gather on - turns on the minimap tracking functionality.
/gather off - turns off the minimap tracking functionality. (note, gathering activities are still tracked, even though they do not appear in the minimap)
/gather toggle - toggles the gatherer between on and off states.
/gather dist number - sets the minimap tracking distance to this number of units. (1 unit = 4 seconds of travel)
/gather num number - sets the maximum number of items that will appear in your minimap at once (max 25)
/gather theme name - changes the default icon theme (available themes: original, shaded, iconic; default = shaded)
/gather idist number - sets a pixel distance in your minimap before the icons will change to iconic (default = 40, minimap radius = 60)
/gather herbs (on|off|auto) - select whether to show herb data on the minimap
/gather mining (on|off|auto) - select whether to show mining data on the minimap
/gather treasure (on|off|auto) - select whether to show treasure data on the minimap
/gather options - show/hide configuration dialog
/gather loginfo (on|off) - show/hide configuration info at logon

If you find any bugs, please use the tracker on the sourceforge site (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=137353), forums are also available at http://norganna.org/bb/index.php?showforum=8 .

Notes:
The herbs, mining and treasure options are per-character settings (meaning it remembers the settings for each character individually.
The auto setting uses the character's skills to determine whether they should see the herbs or mines. Treasures are always shown when they are on auto.
The Database itself is sharer across all characters.
