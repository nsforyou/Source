Expose Armor without doing DMG

/script CastSpellByName("Expose Armor")
/script ClearTarget();

you could use that in Duels, when you Gauge an enemy, using this makro to reduce his armor without getting him out of the CC and than go into stealth, BÃ„M AMBUSH
now thats going to hurt

/cast Expose Armor
/script ClearTarget();
