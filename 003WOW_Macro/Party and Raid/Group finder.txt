About
This is a macro that aims to slightly enhance "/who whispering".

What is "/who whispering"?

"/who whispering" is where you get a list of players using the /who command and whisper them. I've always found this method to be the quickest and easiest way to build a group, especially when you're looking for specific roles; notably tanks and healers.

Setup
 

Create the "set message & reset" macro, and edit the message between the " ":

/run lfm_msg=     "LF3M RFC: Lv.14+ Tank, Heal, RDPS"     ;lfm_i=1;message(lfm_msg);

Create the "send message" macro:

/run if(lfm_i<=GetNumWhoResults()) then lfm_target=GetWhoInfo(lfm_i);SendChatMessage(lfm_msg,"WHISPER",nil,lfm_target);lfm_i=lfm_i+1;else message("Finished who list.");end;

Usage
 

1. Use /who to get a list of players to recruit (ex. /who 18 c-"warrior")
2. Run the "set message & reset" macro once
3. Run the "send message" macro repeatedly to whisper each player in the /who list
- A message will appear when you've finished the list
4. When you finish the list, repeat steps 1-3 with a new list of different players
- * Important * If the /who list contains previously whispered names, it will rewhisper them
- New /who list example: /who 16 c-"warrior"
- Step 2 must be repeated to reset the macro's list position
